  <h1>Theories of Meaningful Conversation</h1>
  <p>This page explores some key thinkers and ideas that can help us understand how to have more constructive, respectful dialogue — especially across political and ideological divides.</p>

  <h2>Jürgen Habermas – Communicative Action</h2>
  <p>Habermas emphasized the importance of mutual understanding and rational dialogue in democratic societies. He argued that communication should aim for consensus, not domination.</p>

  <h2>Hannah Arendt – The Space of Appearance</h2>
  <p>Arendt believed that politics emerges when individuals come together in public to speak and act. For her, dialogue was essential to freedom and human dignity.</p>

  <h2>Chantal Mouffe – Agonistic Pluralism</h2>
  <p>Mouffe argued that conflict is natural in democracy, but it must be channeled into respectful contestation rather than enemy-making. Dialogue doesn’t eliminate disagreement — it makes it safer.</p>

  <h2>Restorative Practices & Nonviolent Communication</h2>
  <p>These practical approaches emphasize active listening, empathy, and understanding needs — especially in moments of tension or harm.</p>
